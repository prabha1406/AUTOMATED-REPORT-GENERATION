DESCRIPTION:

Project Title:

Automated Report Generation using Python

Description:

This project is a Python-based application developed during my internship at CodTech IT Solutions. The objective is to automate the process of generating structured reports from a dataset. The program reads data from a CSV file, performs analysis using the pandas library, visualizes the results using matplotlib, and optionally creates a formatted PDF using the fpdf library.

The report summarizes key metrics like total entries, average values, and frequency counts (e.g., per department), and generates a bar chart for visual analysis. This reduces the need for manual report creation, speeds up decision-making, and improves data presentation.

This automation tool can be used in domains like HR (employee reports), finance (sales summaries), or business analytics (transaction overviews). The project shows how a few lines of Python can replace repetitive reporting tasks with efficient and professional output.

Technologies Used:

Python – Programming language used for scripting and automation

pandas – For data manipulation and analysis

matplotlib – For data visualization

fpdf – (Optional) For creating PDF reports

CSV – Data input format

Input:

A .csv file with structured data such as:

Names

Salaries

Departments (or categories)

Other relevant fields depending on use-case

Workflow:

Read CSV file using pandas

Perform data analysis:

Count total records

Calculate average values (e.g., salary)

Count frequency by department/category

Generate bar chart using matplotlib

(Optional) Create a PDF report:

Add title and metrics

Embed the chart

Save the report

Key Features:

Reads data from a CSV file

Calculates:

Total entries

Average salary

Number of employees per department

Generates a bar chart for visual understanding

Displays results in terminal

Optionally saves:

Chart as an image

Final report as a PDF

Benefits:

Reduces manual report creation effort

Easy to reuse for different datasets

Suitable for real-time analytics or business reporting

Beginner-friendly implementation

Enhances presentation with visuals and layout

Internship Context:

This project was created as Task 2 of my internship at CodTech IT Solutions, under the domain Python Programming. It demonstrates automation of data handling and presentation using Python and its libraries. The focus is on writing clean, structured, and reusable code that simplifies everyday reporting tasks in real-world businesses.

Sample Use-Cases:

HR: Monthly employee reports

Sales: Product-wise sales reports

Finance: Quarterly performance summaries

Education: Student results breakdown
